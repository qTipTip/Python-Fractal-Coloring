"""
This file contains various color_functions for use in the fractal visualizer.
Each color function returns a real number, which is passed to a color_index function
that returns an index 0 <= i <= 1.
Currently the input_line is on the form:
    x_index, y_index, iterations, complex_number
this is subject to change.
